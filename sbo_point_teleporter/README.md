# Point Teleporter [teletool]

Version: 1.5

## Description

This mod adds a new tool: The point teleporter. It is a tool which allows for short-range teleportation.
To use it, leftclick with it on any pointed node, you will be teleported next to surface of the node you have clicked.
The point teleporter has a range of 20 node lengths, but you cannot dig or attack while holding it.
However, to teleport, the destination needs to have enough space, there must be at least 1×2×1 nodes of passable space.

Point teleporters comes in three varieties, which only differ in how often you can use them and whether and which energy source they use:
* Infinite point teleporter: You can use it without limits. Range 20 blocks

It also supports the `tt` mod for tooltip extensions.

## Configuration

You probably do not need to configure the mod, and the settings are mostly only provided for testing and using the default
configuration is recommended. But you can change it anyways, if you wish. Look up the settings in the Minetest settings menu.
